# Long-app

This app is to demonstrate my skills as a full-stack web developer

in this app I used React to build my frontend and node to handle the backend side

for the database I used MongoDB

it's a simple e-commerce website that have a home screen, product screen, checkout screen, payment, signin screen and admin dashboard
